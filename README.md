# WeatherFetcher

Developed an automated python script utilizing modules such as requests, smtp, and geocoder to fetch real-time
weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on my laptopâ€™s current location.
Makes use of the schedule module to trigger daily alerts directly to my phone as sms via email.
